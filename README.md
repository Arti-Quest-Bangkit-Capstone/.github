According to the Badan Pusat Statistik in 2021, 9 out of 10 individuals aged 5 years and older in Indonesia have never visited historical sites or cultural heritage places. This indicates that the interest of the Indonesian public in visiting museums and cultural heritage sites is still low. There are still other threats to museums and cultural heritage, one of which is the damage to historical objects due to fires and natural disasters (BBC, 2023). Objects in museums are vulnerable to physical damage or loss, necessitating digitization to enable the storage of an accurate digital database of artifacts, sites, and historical objects.
Unfortunately, according to a researcher at Udayana University, many artifacts and cultural heritage items in Indonesia remain undocumented, and the collected digital data doesn't have a centralized database yet. Low awareness from the community and the threat of damage to cultural heritage can result in the loss of cultural diversity in Indonesia.
So, what kind of database application can increase Indonesian public interest in visiting museums and understanding more about cultural heritage? An interactive application that provides a centralized database and information about tangible cultural heritage in Indonesia, collaborating with museums and cultural heritage institutions.
